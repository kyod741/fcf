# fcf
fcf is a simple rust cli tool built to make accessing your configs faster

## Usage

### Install Cargo (Linux/MacOs)

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Install Cargo (Windows)
You can install Cargo on Windows on your own responsibility(however using Windows is not advised and there aren't many uses for fcf there).
You can find the guide [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

### Install the fcf crate from crates.io
Just run
```bash
cargo install fcf
```
